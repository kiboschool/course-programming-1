# Assignment
  
> 🧑‍💻 This is an individual exercise. It is based on this week's content so you should
> review that to set you up for the assignment. You are expected to work independently.
>
> If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample. 


This week's assignment comprises 3 independent exercises which will test your 
understanding of the use of lists in python. You are required to complete
all of them in order to get full marks. Specific instructions for each exercise are 
in the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder. The exercises are:

* list-average - Use a loop to find the average of a list of numbers.
* longest-word - Ask the user for five words, then display the longest of these.
* safari-animals - Print out the description of an animal, based on user input.
