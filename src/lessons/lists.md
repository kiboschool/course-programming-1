# Lists

At the end of the last lesson, you saw how the `for` loop gave you the power to loop through a list of items. In this lesson, you’ll learn more about working with **lists**, and see how lists and loops together make for powerful programming patterns.

You’ll also focus on problem-solving using loops, and practice breaking problems down into pieces so that you can find solutions step by step.

## Topics covered

Here's a preview of what you'll learn this week:

- Lists store multiple pieces of data, like `[1, "hello", [ "another list" ], False]`
- You access list elements by their index, which starts at 0, like `my_list[0]`
- You can change list contents by assigning at an index, appending, or removing elements
  - assigning: `my_list[0] = 5`
  - appending `my_list.append(10)`
  - removing `my_list.pop(2)`
- You can solve many problems (like the ones below) by updating a variable at each step in a loop
  - total and average
  - maximum and minimum
  - finding and filtering
