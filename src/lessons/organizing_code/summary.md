# Summary

**Clean code** is an organized code that is easy to read and understand. It is also code that is easy to change and extend.

## Cost of Bad Code

- The cost of **bad code** is time, money, and frustration.
- Bad code is hard understand and hard to change. Therefore, it is hard to extend and debug.

## Functions

- Use functions to break your code into smaller pieces that are easier to understand and easier to change.
- Functions also allow you to **reuse** code. If you find yourself copying and pasting code, you should consider using a function instead.
- Type annotations are a good way to document your code by describing the types of the parameters and return values of your functions.

## Naming

- Good names are **very important** . Use good names for variables, functions, parameters, files, etc.
- Good names make your code easier to understand.
- Good names should be descriptive and meaningful.

## Comments

- Your code should be **self-documenting**. This means that your code should be easy to understand **without** comments.
- You can use comments to explain **why** your code does something and for further clarification.

## Modules

- Use modules to organize your code into separate files.
- Each file should contain related code logic.
