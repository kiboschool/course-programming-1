**Due date: TBD**

> 💡 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Microprocessor Simulation

The microprocessor is the chip at the heart of every computer. Inside the
microprocessor is an _Arithmetic Logic Unit_ (ALU) that performs very simple 
operations on numbers.

In this project, you will write a program that simulates a bit of what a 
microprocessor does. You'll use lots of helper functions. Since your program
will be larger than the programs you've written before, you'll have to think
carefully about how you organize your code, and how it works together.
