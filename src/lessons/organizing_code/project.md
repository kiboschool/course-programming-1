## Microprocessor Simulation

The microprocessor is the chip at the heart of every computer. Inside the
microprocessor is an [_Arithmetic Logic Unit_ (ALU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) that performs very simple
operations on numbers.

In this project, you will write a program that simulates a bit of what a
microprocessor does. You'll use lots of helper functions. Since your program
will be larger than the programs you've written before, you'll have to think
carefully about how you organize your code, and how it works together.
