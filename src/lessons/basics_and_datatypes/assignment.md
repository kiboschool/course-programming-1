# Assignment
  
> 🧑‍💻 This is an individual exercise. It is based on this week's content so you should
> review that to set you up for the assignment. You are expected to work independently.
>
> If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample. 


This week's assignment comprises 3 independent exercises which will test your 
understanding of basic python datatypes and operations. You are required to complete
all of them in order to get full marks. Specific instructions for each exercise are 
in the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder. The exercises are:
* USD-to-Naira conversion - Convert a user-provided USD value to NGN
* AC-load estimator - Calculate the AC requirements of a building given its physical dimensions and the number of occupants
* Body mass index calculator - Given an individual's height and weight, calculate their BMI

## Submission

In order to get credit for your project, you must:

- push your code to Github Classroom
- submit your work in Gradescope
- submit your project in Woolf

It is possible to get partial credit for partial submission

This video walks through the process of submitting your project:

## Late Policy

This assignment is due on Sunday evening (please check Gradescope for the precise time and convert to your time zone). You have a 24 hour grace period to submit the assignment after the deadline with no penalty.  However, no late assignments will be accepted beyond that time without special permission from the instructor (only for extenuating circumstances) and will received a 25% penalty. *Please start your assignments early, and allow appropriate buffer for potential issues (e.g., internet connectivity, electrical outages, etc.).*

## Collaboration Policy

Students are encouraged to study and learn together. Another student is often the best resource for working out a complex computation or understanding a difficult concept. *However, all work turned in to fulfill course requirements must be the exclusive work of the person submitting them, unless otherwise stated in the assignment.* In order to allow students to work together, yet submit assignments that represent their own understanding, the **Gilligan’s Island Rule** (which has been attributed to Larry Ruzzo of the University of Washington) is adopted.

**The Gilligan’s Island Rule:** You are free to meet with fellow students and discuss an assignment with them. Writing on a board or shared space during the meeting is acceptable; however, you should not take any written (electronic or otherwise) record away from the meeting. If you get help from a book or the Web, you must put the source aside after you have obtained help and put away any notes you took. Everything that you derive from the collaboration should be in your head. After the meeting, engage in at least a half-hour of mind-numbing activity (like watching an episode of Gilligan’s Island), before starting to work on the assignment. This will ensure that you are able to reconstruct what you learned from the meeting by yourself. (Gilligan’s Island was a 1960s US sitcom that set the standard for dim-witted TV.)

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions in the exercise's `README.md` file
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord
