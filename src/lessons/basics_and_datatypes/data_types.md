# Data types

## What you need to know about data types

- Python can store different **types** of data
- The basic types of data youâ€™ll learn about first are:
  - Strings
  - Integers
  - Floats
  - Booleans
- Python can do different operations based the data type
  - like `+` to add numbers together

## Basic Data Types

Your name, age, date of birth, and photo are different pieces of data. Data, and the variables that refer to them, are represented by different _types_.

Every programming language has data types, but the built-in types are different from one programming language to another. In Python, we have more than 10 built-in data types. Here are the 3 types we need in this lesson:

- **int** (for integer)
  - Represents integer numbers, like `1`, `4`, or `10`
- **float** (a floating-point number)
  - Represents floating-point numbers, like `1.0`, `4.32`, or `10.189`
  - You might know these as â€˜decimalâ€™ numbers or fractions - numbers that have a dot separating the integer part from the fractional part.
- **str** (for string)
  - Stores text as character-based data like words, e.g., `Hello World`

These are called _primitive types_. Python can represent more complicated data using _compound types_ like List and Dictionary, which are made out of the primitive types. Weâ€™ll learn about some of those in later lessons.

Python figures out the type automatically based on some rules:

- numbers without a decimal point are treated as **ints** (like `10`)
- numbers with a decimal point are treated as **floats** (like `1.0`)
- text between quote marks is treated as **strings** (like `"Hello"` or `'100.5'`)

There are more rules for other types, but we're skipping them for now.

## Data Types

Every value in Python has a type, for example, **string**, **float**, and **integer**. You can find out what type a value is by using the `type()` function.

### Strings

**Strings** are for representing text.

They look like this: `"Kibo School"`, starting and ending with `"`, the _double quote_.

When you add them together with `+`, Python _concatenates_ the strings. It sticks them together end to end, like this:

```python
school_name = "Kibo"
print("I love " + school_name) # "I love Kibo"
```

They are called _strings_ because they are a series (a â€˜stringâ€™) of characters. The string `"Kibo"` is made of the characters `'K'`, `'i'`, `'b'`, `'o'`.

### Integers

**Integers** are for representing positive and negative whole numbers.

They look like numbers: `10`, `9019`, or `-5`

Python works like a calculator. It can do math with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and more.

```python
10 + 5 # 15

value = 100
value + 10 # 110
value - 10 # 90
value * 10 # 1000
value / 10 # 10
```

### Floats

**Floats** are for representing fractional numbers

They look like numbers with a decimal point: `10.5`, `90.19`, or `-0.781`

Python stores them differently from integers, so they show something different when you call `type` on them

### TypeErrors

**TypeError** is a common error you get when the types donâ€™t match, like if you tried to add a string and a number.

```python
"Hello" + "5" # "Hello5"
"Hello" + 5 # TypeError
```

There are lots more Python types that we didnâ€™t cover. You can look them up by using Google to find the Python documentation.
