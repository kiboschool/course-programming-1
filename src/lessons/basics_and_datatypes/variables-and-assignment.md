# Variables and assignment

## What you need to know about variables

- A _variable_ is a name you give to data, so you can use it later in the program
- You assign a value to a variable with `=`
- There are lots names you can use for variables, but there are some rules
- Using meaningful variable names makes your program better

### Video Notes

- Working with variables and data is a core part of learning programming
- A **Variable** is a named place in memory. We can use it to store data and manipulate it, using its name.
- An **assignment statement** assigns some value (on the right-hand side) to the variable name on the left-hand side. Technically this means putting this value in memory and point to it using that variable name.

## Assignment Operators

We learned about the `=` operator which is also called the **assignment operator**. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

There are other assignment operators in Python, which are shortcuts for doing math and assigning the result to a variable.

For example, the `+=` operator adds the value on the right to the variable on the left, and assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```python
x = 10
x += 5 # x is now 15
```

There are other similar assignment operators, like `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` that works the same way.

### Video Notes

Variable names in Python must follow some rules:

- We cannot use **reserved words** variables names. Reserved words include words like `if`, `for,` `return`, which have specific meanings in Python
- Names can start with letters or underscores, and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They can‚Äôt have spaces.
- Variable names are case-sensitive. That means `shop` and `Shop` can refer to different values.

### Good and Bad Variable Names

Variable names should be descriptive and help a reader understand the code.

For example, take a look at the code below:

```python
x1q3z9ocd = 35.0
x1q3z9afd = 12.50
x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ocd * x1q3z9afd
print(x1q3p9afd) # 437.5
```

The variable names above are allowed in Python, but they are **not helpful**.

**Contrast with:**

```python
hours = 35.0
pay_rate = 12.50
pay = hours * pay_rate
print(pay) # 437.5
```

These variable names are descriptive and helpful!

<summary><strong>Solution</strong> (try for 5 minutes before looking!)</summary>

```python
books_read = 13
print(books_read)

meals_eaten = 4
meals_eaten = meals_eaten + 1
# you can use the += operator to do the same thing:
# meals_eaten += 1

print(meals_eaten)
```
