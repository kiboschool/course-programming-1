# Operators

**Operators** are symbols or characters that perform specific operations on operands, such as variables or values.They allow us to manipulate data and perform various calculations or comparisons.

There are different types of operators in Python. In this week, we will learn about **arithmetic operators** and **assignment operators**. Next week, we will learn about **comparison operators** and **logical operators**. We will learn about more operators in future lessons.

## Arithmetic Operators

- `+` performs **addition**
- `-` performs **subtraction**
- `*` performs **multiplication**
- `/` performs **division**
- `**` performs **exponentiation**
- `%` performs **modulo operation (the remainder after integer division)**

## What would happen?

Try to guess what each snippet would print out. Then, click the arrow to see an
explanation.

<details>
<summary>

```python
print(5 + 10)
```

</summary>

It would print `15`.

First, python adds `5` and `10`, then it does the `print`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

```python
print(4 + 3 * 2)
```

</summary>

It would print `10`.

First, python multiplies `3` and `2` and gets `6`. Then it adds `6` to `4`, then it prints the final result.

There are other operators, like comparison, assignment, and logical operators. We will cover assignment operators in this lesson, and the rest in future lessons.

## Using the Repl to explore

The best way to learn how the Python operators behave is to try out different
operators and see what they do.

- Open a Python repl on your computer by entering `python` in a terminal
- Set a timer for 5 minutes and try to find out as much as you can about the
  operators.
- Ask yourself questions, then try entering the code in the REPL to
  answer your question.

**What's a REPL?**

REPL stands for _read_ _evaluate_ _print_ _loop_. That's what a REPL does - it
reads a line of code, evaluates it, prints out the result, and then does that
again (a loop!)

A REPL is a common tool that programmers use to explore some idea, check some
syntax, or find something out while they are developing.
