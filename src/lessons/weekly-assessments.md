# Weekly Assessments

Each week, you'll need to submit a piece of work involving the new skills and concepts 
you learned. This page lists all of weekly assessments. This will be done via assignments
and projects.

Assignments will be a number of small self-contained exercises each of which you should 
be able to do quite quickly if you have understood the week's content. The projects 
however will be a bit challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

Each assessment is due at the end of the corresponding week. The list below shows which
kind of assessment is given on each week.
