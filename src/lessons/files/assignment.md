# Assignment

This week's assignment comprises 2 independent exercises which will test your 
understanding of how to manipulate files in python. You are required to complete
all of them in order to get full marks. Specific instructions for each exercise are 
in the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder. The exercises are:

* binary-file-info: Write a program that accepts the name of a binary file from standard input, and prints out the name, size, and type of the file.
* count-file-lines: Write a program that takes in the name of a file as input, then prints out the number of lines in that file. As an option, it can also take in a string to filter the lines. If a string is provided, it should only count the lines that contain that string.
