# Final Project

**Due date: TBD**

> 💡 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.
>
> If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.

## Population Analysis

This is a chance to be creative with the new skills you've learned.

In this project, you will be guided through an initial analysis of population
data using all the concepts you've learned in the course. Once you've completed
the initial analysis, you can choose what other analysis or features you'd like
to add to the project.

**Access** the assignment here: https://github.com/kiboschool/population-analysis

Remember...

- **Read** the instructions
- **Plan** before you code
- **Debug** if you aren't getting the desired output
- **Attend** office hours if you need additional support
- **Ask** for help in Discord

## Presentations

In the last week, you'll schedule a time to present your work. You'll show the
output of your application, and answer some questions about how the code works.

It will be a fun time to see what your classmates have come up with, as well as
a chance to show off what you've made.

## Evaluation

Here's what we'll be looking for when evaluating your project:

* Does the code run without errors?
* Does the solution solve the initial prompt?
* Does your extension from the initial analysis make use of the skills you've
    learned in the course?
* Do your analysis, code, and presentation demonstrate creativity, understanding, and clear
    communication?
