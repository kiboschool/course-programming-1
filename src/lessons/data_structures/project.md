# Project: Directory maintainer

>🧑‍💻 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

>If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.


In this project, you will be working to clean up a messy directory.
The reporting and data team has generated several amazing reports. However, these files 
need to be organised for them to be useful and manageable. We have to do this using a
program because the team will definitely create more amazing reports.

In doing this we shall practice working with files, keeping track of their properties
and manipulating their locations.
