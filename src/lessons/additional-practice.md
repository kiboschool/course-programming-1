# Additional Practice

If you finish the exercises (and you are up to date on your other courses), you 
can continue to practice programming.

We recommend that you start with the Exercism python track. If you complete it,
and complete the Python exercises, then you can move on to the other resources.

* [Exercism Python track](https://exercism.org/tracks/python)

These sites host programming problems to solve. They are often educational, and
can help when it is time to prepare for technical interviews. Sometimes the
problems are poorly written or hard to understand, in which case it might be a
problem to skip over for now.

## Practice tips

* It's good to look at other solutions, but only after you've tried solving a
  problem. If you come up with a solution that works, try to notice how someone
  else solved the same problem, and what you might do to revise your solution.
* It can be good to try solving the same problem a second time, after some days
  or weeks have passed. Has the problem gotten easier, now that you have
  solved it before?
* It's fun to solve problems with friends. If you have a solution you really
  like, you can share it with the squad or community. Remember to use spoiler
  tags so that you don't ruin the problem in case someone else wants to try it.
* Practice should be challenging, but you shouldn't spend hours stuck on a 
  problem without making progress. If you are stuck, take a break, ask for help,
  try another problem, and return to the problem later.
* Take a break! It's often helpful to walk around, drink water, eat a bite of
  food, then return to a problem refreshed. Some problems that seem impossible
  become very easy when approached with a fresh mind.
