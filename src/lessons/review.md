# Review

This is the end of the material for this course.

Instead of introducing any new topics to use in your project, you'll review all
that you've learned. It's key to take time to reflect on what you know now, what
you're still confused about, and what you might learn next.

## Preview

There's tons more to learn about Python and programming.

Here's our list of some of the topics to study next. Before looking at the list, take a few moments to write down what questions you have, and what topics you'd like to learn more about. Think about which ones are coming next, which ones you might learn in a future class, and which you might want to try to learn outside of class.
