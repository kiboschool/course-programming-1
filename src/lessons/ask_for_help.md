# Tips on Asking For Help

When asking for help, include the following information:

1. Details of your goal.

   _"I am trying to [goal]."_

2. Details of what you have tried so far.

   _"I have tried [details of how you have tried to solve the problem already]."_

3. Helpful context.

   _“Here’s a screenshot of my code."_

**❌ Don’t Write**

- “need help”
- “I’m stuck on problem 3”
- “Can anyone help?”
- “Hi”

**✅ Do Write**

<<<<<<< HEAD
- “I’m working on solving problem three, and getting this error when I run my code: [screenshot]. Can anyone help explain this error? I don’t get it.”
- “I’m trying to print all the values in this list for my project, but it keeps saying `NameError: name ‘item’ is not defined`. Here's a screenshot of my code. I tried changing the list, but that didn't work."

## Screenshots

It’s often helpful to include a screenshot with your question. Here’s how:

- **Windows:** press the Windows key + Print Screen key
  - the screenshot will be saved to the Pictures > Screenshots folder
  - _alternatively: press the Windows key + Shift + S to open the snipping tool_
- **Mac:** press the Command key + Shift key + 4
  - it will save to your desktop, and show as a thumbnail

## Peer collaboration

You can work with your peers on exercises, and on some of the projects, as
specified in the project instructions.

When you work with a peer, be sure that you:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Collaborate effectively: communicate with your peers about when you will meet
  and what you will do
- **Write code yourself**: do not just watch someone else solve the problem. You
  have to write lots of code in this course in order to succeed.
- Read and understand your peers' code: seeing how someone else solves a problem

  share with your partner. If there's something in their code you are confused
  by, _ask_
