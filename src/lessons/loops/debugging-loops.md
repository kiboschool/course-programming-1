# Debugging loops

Usually it takes more than one try to write the code to solve a problem with loops. When the code isn‚Äôt working correctly, you need a strategy for figuring out what is happening, and to fix it.

## Loop debugging: Printing each step

**Printing values at each step** is a strategy for debugging what‚Äôs happening in your loop. Let‚Äôs see what it looks like.

Here‚Äôs some broken code for solving a loop problem:

```python
# Find the total of the even numbers from 2 to 12
total = 0
for i in range(1,12,2):
	total + i
print(total) # 0  <- Wrong, should not be 0!
```

You might be able to spot the bug in this code, but let‚Äôs try printing out the values to debug it.

```python
total = 0
print("before the loop total is", total)
for i in range(1,12,2):
	print("i is", i, "total is", total)
	total + i
print("after the loop total is", total)
print(total)
```

Here‚Äôs the output:

```
before the loop total is 0
i is 1 total is 0
i is 3 total is 0
i is 5 total is 0
i is 7 total is 0
i is 9 total is 0
i is 11 total is 0
after the loop total is 0
0
```

Wow! It looks like there are actually 3 bugs!

- instead of the even numbers, `i` is getting set to the odd numbers
- instead of including `12`, it‚Äôs stopping at `11`
- `total` isn‚Äôt changing at all in the loop

### Fixing the code

Since we can see the values, it‚Äôs much easier to tell what we need to fix.

- `range` needs to start at `2` (instead of `1`)
- `range` needs to stop at `13` (instead of `12`)
- it needs to be `total += i` instead of `total + i`

When we fix the code, we can leave the `print`s in to make sure our changes work.

```python
total = 0
print("before the loop total is", total)
for i in range(2,13,2):
	print("i is", i, "total is", total)
	total += i
print("after the loop total is", total)
print(total)
```

Now the output is:

```
before the loop total is 0
i is 2 total is 0
i is 4 total is 2
i is 6 total is 6
i is 8 total is 12
i is 10 total is 20
i is 12 total is 30
after the loop total is 42
42
```

Now that we can see that the code is working, we can remove the extra `print` statements. Here‚Äôs the final code:

```python
total = 0
for i in range(2,13,2):
	total += i
print(total)
```

<summary>Solution (try for 10-20 minutes before looking)</summary>

```python
total = 0
print("total before is", total)
for i in range(10,25,2):
  print("i is", i, "total is", total)
  total + i
print("total after is", total)
print(total)

# BUGS
# - supposed to be the odd numbers (range should start at 11)
# - supposed to include 25 (range should end at 26)
# - should be total += i
```

## Loop debugging: Visual Tracing

When debugging more complicated code, it‚Äôs helpful to be able to see how the code executes step by step. You can use [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=display) to run your code step by step, and see the values of all your variables as the program runs.

Similar to printing out the values at each step, PythonTutor helps you see what‚Äôs happening when your code runs. That makes it easier to spot bugs.

Here‚Äôs the [**example from before in pythontutor**](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=%23%20Does%20the%20list%20have%20string%20%22Python%22%20in%20it%3F%0Alanguages%20%3D%20%5B%22Ruby%22,%20%22JavaScript%22,%20%22C%22,%20%22Rust%22,%20%22Smalltalk%22,%20%22Clojure%22,%20%22Python%22%5D%0A%0Ahas_match%20%3D%20False%0Afor%20language%20in%20languages%3A%0A%20%20%20%20if%20language%20%3D%3D%20%22Python%22%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20has_match%20%3D%20True%0A%0Aprint%28has_match%29&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false).
