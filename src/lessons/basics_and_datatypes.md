## Week 1 Goal

In this week, you'll get up and running with Python. You'll learn what a program is and how to write and run programs that use Python's basic data types and operators.

## Topics Covered

Here are some of the specific topics you'll learn in these lessons:

- **Comments** let us put text in a program that will be ignored by the program but are useful for humans reading the program. Comments in Python start with the `#` sign.
- **Variables** are a way to store data with a name, so you can use it later. Creating a variable looks like `name = "Mo"` or `age = 22`
- **Strings** are the Python data type for text, and they look like `"hello world"`
- **Ints** and **Floats** are the Python data types for numbers, and they look like `9` or `0.7`
- Python can use **operators** like `+` to add numbers or concatenate strings
- `print` shows output to the user, and `input` asks the user to type in text
- Strings can be concatenated (added together) using the `+` and using `f-strings`
- You can format strings a variety of ways using f-strings
