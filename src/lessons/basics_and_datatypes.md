## Week 1 Goal

In these lessons, you'll get up and running with Python.

If you've never programmed before, there's a few questions you probably have:

- What is a program?
- How do I write and run programs?

We'll try to answer those questions, and by the end of this chapter, you'll be
writing and running programs of your own. They'll start simple, but you'll use
what you learn for the rest of your time with Python.

Part of getting started is learning how Python represents data. The other focus
of these first few lessons will be the basic Python _data types_, what they are
for, and how to convert between them.

## Learning Objectives

Here are some of the specific topics you'll learn in these lessons:

- **Comments** let us put text in a program that will be ignored by the program but are useful for humans reading the program. Comments in Python start with the `#` sign.
- **Variables** are a way to store data with a name, so you can use it later. Creating a variable looks like `name = "Mo"` or `age = 22`
- **Strings** are the Python data type for text, and they look like `"hello world"`
- **Ints** and **Floats** are the Python data types for numbers, and they look like `9` or `0.7`
- Python can use **operators** like `+` to add numbers or concatenate strings
- `print` shows output to the user, and `input` asks the user to type in text
- Strings can be concatenated (added together) using the `+` and using `f-strings`
- You can format strings a variety of ways using f-strings
