# Assignment

This week's assignment comprises 4 independent exercises which will test your 
understanding of the use of user defined functions in python. You are required to complete
all of them in order to get full marks. Specific instructions for each exercise are 
in the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder. The exercises are:

* add-list-numbers - Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list.
* double-list-elements - Write a function that doubles all the elements in a list.
* smallest-item-in-a-list - Write a function that returns the smallest item in a list of numbers.
* unit-conversion-functions - Write four functions. Each function takes in a value in one unit (e.g. kg), and converts it to another unit (e.g. lbs).
