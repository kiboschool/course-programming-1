# Individual Project: Rock Paper Scissors

**Due date: TBD**

📌 This is an individual project. You are expected to work independently.

If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-python** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample.


## Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this assignment, you'll recreate the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. If you’ve never played before, or need a refresher: two players each choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. They show their choice at the same time. Depending on their choice, there’s a win, lose, or draw.

- Rock smashes Scissors
- Scissors cut Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- If the two choices are the same, it’s a draw
- Rock, Paper, and Scissors are the only choices allowed.
