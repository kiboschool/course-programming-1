# Assignment
  
> 🧑‍💻 This is an individual exercise. It is based on this week's content so you should
> review that to set you up for the assignment. You are expected to work independently.
>
> If you get stuck, confused, or have trouble with the project, you should use the **#help-prog1** channel in Discord or message an instructor. Try not to spoil the project for others - use Discord spoiler tags if you are going to include a screenshot or code sample. 


This week's assignment comprises 3 independent exercises which will test your 
understanding of conditional branching in python. You are required to complete
all of them in order to get full marks. Specific instructions for each exercise are 
in the `README.md` file within each exercise's folder. The exercises are:

* exam-results: Write a program that lets a user enter their exam score, then tells the user if they have passed the exam.
* money-for-books: Write a program that tells users if they have enough money to buy their desired number of books.
* bill-calculator: Build a program to help calculate Electricity and Water bills, turning the utility bill rules into conditions and boolean logic

## Late Policy

This assignment is due on Sunday evening (please check Gradescope for the precise time and convert to your time zone). You have a 24 hour grace period to submit the assignment after the deadline with no penalty.  However, no late assignments will be accepted beyond that time without special permission from the instructor (only for extenuating circumstances) and will received a 25% penalty. *Please start your assignments early, and allow appropriate buffer for potential issues (e.g., internet connectivity, electrical outages, etc.).*

## Collaboration Policy

Students are encouraged to study and learn together. Another student is often the best resource for working out a complex computation or understanding a difficult concept. *However, all work turned in to fulfill course requirements must be the exclusive work of the person submitting them, unless otherwise stated in the assignment.* In order to allow students to work together, yet submit assignments that represent their own understanding, the **Gilligan’s Island Rule** (which has been attributed to Larry Ruzzo of the University of Washington) is adopted.

**The Gilligan's Island Rule:** You are free to meet with fellow students and discuss an assignment with them. Writing on a board or shared space during the meeting is acceptable; however, you should not take any written (electronic or otherwise) record away from the meeting. If you get help from a book or the Web, you must put the source aside after you have obtained help and put away any notes you took. Everything that you derive from the collaboration should be in your head. After the meeting, engage in at least a half-hour of mind-numbing activity (like watching an episode of Gilligan’s Island), before starting to work on the assignment. This will ensure that you are able to reconstruct what you learned from the meeting by yourself. (Gilligan’s Island was a 1960s US sitcom that set the standard for dim-witted TV.)
