# Multi Way decisions

In this section, you will learn how to make decisions in your code based on multiple conditions or choices. We will introduce the `elif` keyword to assist with this.

An example of a multi-way decision could involve checking a student's grade, which could fall into different ranges: greater than 90, between 70 and 90, between 50 and 70, or less than 50.

Another example could be determining the current season based on the month. If it is December, January, or February, we are in winter. If it is March, April, or May, we are in spring, and so on.

Using just `if` or `if/else` statements cannot accommodate more than two choices, so we will introduce a new keyword, `elif`, to address this.

### If-elif statements

`if` and `else` let us express conditions with two possible outcomes. But what if there are more than two possibilities we want to express in our program? `elif` stands for "else if". It lets us check more conditions, so we can cover as many conditions as we want.

Below is the flow control diagram for a multi-branch program:

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
if x < y:
    print('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')
```

The code runs line by line. So, the conditions are checked _in the order the code is written._ The code does not look ahead. So, in the example above, assuming x = 3 and y = 3, the code will do 2 comparisons:

- Check if x is less than y. Since x = 3 and y = 3 this statement is false, and it keeps going
- Check if x is greater than y. Since x = 3 and y = 3, this statement is false
- Execute the else statement and print 'x and y are equal'

But with x = 4 and y = 6, the code will run the first comparison, print `'x is less than y'` and finish. It will never even run the second check!

There is no limit on the number of `elif` statements that can be added, but the code will evaluate them from top to bottom. Having an `else` statement is optional, but if you have one, it has to be at the end.

## Practice

The sample run of the code should now look like this:

## If/elif/Else Exampels

Here is a video to review and practice `if/elif/else` statements with different examples:
